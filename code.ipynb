segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below) In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different

(Tokenization)\\nTokenization is a process used in text analysis that divides text into individual words or word fragments This technique results in two key components: a word index and tokenized text This technique results in two key components: a word index and tokenized text The word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers, and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token The word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers, and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token These numerical tokens are then used in various deep learning methods.\\nFor a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces These numerical tokens are then used in various deep learning methods.\\nFor a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces However, some written languages like

morphemes The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e., the structure of words) of the language being considered The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e., the structure of words) of the language being considered English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g., \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g., \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.\\nPart-of-speech tagging\\nGiven a

a noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.\\nStemming\\nThe process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to a base form (e.g., \"close\" will be the root for \"closed\", \"closing\", \"close\", \"closer\" etc.) For example, \"book\" can be a noun (\"the book on the table\") or verb (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.\\nStemming\\nThe process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to a base form (e.g., \"close\"

any case, is often inaccurate or insufficient Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named

===\\nAffine transformations enable basic image transformations including scale, rotate, translate, mirror and shear as is shown in the following examples:\\n\\nTo apply the affine matrix to an image, the image is converted to matrix in which each entry corresponds to the pixel intensity at that location Then each pixel\\'s location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image, [x, y], where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix Then each pixel\\'s location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image, [x, y], where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix This allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affine-transformation matrix, which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output image.\\nHowever, to allow transformations that require translation transformations, 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed This allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affine-transformation matrix, which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output image.\\nHowever, to allow transformations that require translation transformations, 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed The third dimension is usually set to a non-zero constant, usually 1, so that the new coordinate is [x, y, 1] The third dimension is usually set to a non-zero constant, usually 1, so that the new coordinate is [x, y, 1] This allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a 3 by 3 matrix, enabling translation shifts This allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a 3 by 3 matrix, enabling translation shifts So the third dimension, which is the constant 1, allows translation.\\nBecause matrix multiplication is associative, multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done So the third dimension, which is the constant 1, allows translation.\\nBecause matrix multiplication is associative, multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done This results in a single matrix that, when applied to a point vector, gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector [x, y, 1] in sequence This results in a single matrix that, when applied to a point vector, gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector [x, y, 1] in sequence Thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrix.\\nFor example, 2 dimensional coordinates only allow rotation about the origin (0, 0) Thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrix.\\nFor example, 2 dimensional coordinates only allow rotation about the origin (0, 0) But 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to (0, 0), then perform the rotation, and lastly translate the origin (0, 0) back to the original point (the opposite of the first translation) But 3 dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to (0, 0), then perform the rotation, and lastly translate the origin (0, 0) back to the original point (the opposite of the first translation) These 3 affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix, thus allowing rotation around any point in the image.\\n\\n\\n=== Image denoising with Morphology ===\\nMathematical morphology is suitable for denoising images These 3 affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix, thus allowing rotation around any point in the image.\\n\\n\\n=== Image denoising with Morphology ===\\nMathematical morphology is suitable for denoising images
